    """Base class for Kona objective functions, designed to be a template for
    any objective functions intended to be used for ``kona.Optimize()``.

    This class provides some standard mathematical functionality via NumPy
    arrays and operators. However, attributes of the derived classes can have
    different data types. In these cases, the user must redefine the
    mathematical operation methods for these non-standard data types.

    This solver wrapper is not initialized by Kona. The user must initialize it
    before handing it over to Kona's optimizer. Therefore the intialization
    implementation details are left up to the user entirely. Below is just an
    example used by Kona's own test problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_primal : int, optional
        Primal space size.
    num_state : int, optional
        State space size.
    num_dual : int, optional
        Dual space size.
    allocator : BaseAllocator, optional
        Allocator object that produces the abstracted vector data containers.

    Attributes
    ----------
    num_design : int
        Size of the design space
    num_state : int, optional
        Number of state variables
    num_dual : int, optional
        Number of constraints (equality and inequality together)
    allocator : BaseAllocator
        Object that allocates BaseVector instances when Kona asks for it.
