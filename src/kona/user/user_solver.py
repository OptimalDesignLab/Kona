    any objective functions intended to be used for ``kona.Optimize()``.

    This class provides some standard mathematical functionality via NumPy
    arrays and operators. However, attributes of the derived classes can have
    different data types. In these cases, the user must redefine the
    mathematical operation methods for these non-standard data types.

    This solver wrapper is not initialized by Kona. The user must initialize it
    before handing it over to Kona's optimizer. Therefore the intialization
    implementation details are left up to the user entirely. Below is just an
    example used by Kona's own test problems.
