Kona is a library for nonlinear constrained optimization. It was designed
primarily for partial-differential-equation (PDE) governed
optimization problems; however it is suitable for any (sufficiently smooth)
problem where the objective function and/or constraints require the solution of
a computational expensive state equation. Kona is also useful for developing
new optimization algorithms for PDE-governed optimization as a result of its
abstracted vector and matrix implementations.
